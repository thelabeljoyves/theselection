<p>As part of Ultra-red’s twenty-year anniversary in 2014, the collective published nine workbooks detailing sound investigations conducted between 2010 and 2014. Since 1994, the international collective Ultra-red has launched militant sound investigations in social movements such as HIV/AIDS justice, housing, anti-racism, struggles of migration, radical education, and resistance to the war on the poor. The workbooks in this set range from short-term inquiries to long-term investigations drawing on years of work embedded in specific<br />
Winning the Turner prize does not necessarily depend on one artist delivering a knock-out exhibition. Juries consider each artist’s work as a whole (though the show itself can make or break their chance of winning). Assemble don’t really do gallery shows. Their art ignores the art market. Useful and inspiring, Assemble demonstrate how artists and architects can engage with communities, and work creatively in the wider social sphere. 
During the 1970s and 80s many artists, living in short-term properties (most famously through the London artist’s housing and studio co-op ACME), temporarily regenerated patches of east London destined for the bulldozers. With studios and housing unaffordable in London now, such ventures are vital. But Assemble isn’t just about artists doing it for themselves. Their work can be seen as part of a battle against social division, and against the precariousness of life under neo-liberal capitalism. How right-on, you might say.<br />
The danger of projects like theirs is that it will be seen to replace government intervention, leading to further withdrawals of public funds and further atomisation. (They might easily have been instrumentalised by David Cameron’s bullshit talk on The Big Society had he had the chance.) But not every community has an Assemble round the corner on hand to help.

I am unsurprised that Assemble have won, given that one of the current Turner judges, Alistair Hudson, director of Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art (mima), views his museum as a service to the community, a facility rather than a place where big-shot artists have major shows. How good is Assemble’s work? It is full of invention and ingenuity. It has purpose. What they are not doing is following a familiar artistic career pattern. It is art if they say so, and I don’t care if it is art or not. Winning the Turner prize is a vindication of their work.
